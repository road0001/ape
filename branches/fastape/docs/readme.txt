So far none of the actual changes have been uploaded, but they will be fairly soon. This branch probably will focus on optimization and helpful/cool features relating to the physics system. I'm not planning on implementing any new physics such as new particles right now, because well...my trig is a little rusty. I am also thinking of separating out the physics and rendering code, and forming a small demo rendering engine to show how you could interface with APE efficiently.

To upload soon:

spatial partitioning
sqrt optimization

I will be keeping track of the classes and functions that have been changed or added in the history. This should make it easier for everyone wishing to mix and match from different branches (I know I will be).
